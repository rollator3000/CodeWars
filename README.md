# CodeWars
Various excerises from 'https://www.codewars.com/'  

## Overview
CodeWars offerst various exercises to train coding in different coding languages. Currently I'm only focusing on the languages 'R' & 'Python'.   
The difficulty of the exercises ranges from '8Kata' - '1Kata', whereby the exercises with '8Kata' are the most simple ones & exercises with '1Kata' are the most complicated!  
To each language and degree of difficulty there is a seperate 'ipynb'/ '.rmd' file. 
Each file contains exercise(s) from codewars, their challenge, the test the code has to pass & an own solution
