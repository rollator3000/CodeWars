# CodeWars
Various excerises from 'https://www.codewars.com/'  

## Overview
CodeWars offerst various exercises to train coding for various coding languages. Currently I'm only focusing on the languages 'R' & 'Python'.   
The difficulty of the exercises ranges from '8Kata' to '1Kata', whereby the exercises with '8Kata' are the most simple ones & exercises with '1Kata' are the most complicated ones!  
The exercises are split by the language and their their degree of difficulty.

Each 'ipynb' contains exercise(s) from codewars, their challenge & the test the code has to pass
