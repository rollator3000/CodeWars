    "# 1. Strings Mix\n",
    "\n",
    "Given two strings s1 and s2, we want to visualize how different the two strings \n",

    "In the same manner 2:bbb stands for string s2 and bbb because the maximum for b is 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task is to produce a string in which each lowercase letters of s1 or s2 \n",
    "appears as many times as its maximum if this maximum is strictly greater than 1; \n",
    "these letters will be prefixed by the number of the string where they appear with\n",
    "their maximum value and :. If the maximum is in s1 as well as in s2 the prefix is E:.\n",
