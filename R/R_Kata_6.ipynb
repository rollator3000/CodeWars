    "# 1. PI approximation\n",

    "The aim of the kata is to try to show how difficult it can be to calculate decimals of an irrational number with a certain precision. We have chosen to get a few decimals of the number \"pi\" using the following infinite series (Leibniz 1646â€“1716):\n",
    "\n",
    "     PI / 4 = 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + ... which gives an approximation of PI / 4.\n",
    "     --> see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz_formula_for_%CF%80\n",
    "     \n",
    "\n",
    "To have a measure of the difficulty we will count how many iterations are needed to calculate PI with a given precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to determine the precision of the calculus but to keep things easy we will calculate to within epsilon of your language Math::PI constant. In other words we will stop the iterative process when the absolute value of the difference between our calculation and the Math::PI constant of the given language is less than epsilon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your function returns an array or an arrayList or a string or a tuple depending on the language (See sample tests) where your approximation of PI has 10 decimals\n",
    "\n",
    "Example :\n",
    "\n",
    "    your function calculates 1000 iterations and 3.140592653839794 but returns:\n",
    "    iter_pi(0.001) --> [1000, 3.1405926538]\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, this series converges too slowly to be useful, as it takes over 300 terms to obtain a 2 decimal place precision. To obtain 100 decimal places of PI, it was calculated that one would need to use at least 10^50 terms of this expansion!"
