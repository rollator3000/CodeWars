    "The aim of the kata is to try to show how difficult it can be to calculate decimals of an irrational number with a certain precision. We have chosen to get a few decimals of the number \"pi\" using the following infinite series (Leibniz 1646â€“1716):\n",

    "To have a measure of the difficulty we will count how many iterations are needed to calculate PI with a given precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to determine the precision of the calculus but to keep things easy we will calculate to within epsilon of your language Math::PI constant. In other words we will stop the iterative process when the absolute value of the difference between our calculation and the Math::PI constant of the given language is less than epsilon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your function returns an array or an arrayList or a string or a tuple depending on the language (See sample tests) where your approximation of PI has 10 decimals\n",
